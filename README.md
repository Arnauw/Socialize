Socialize the best social network ever !

Project to work a little of everything and mostly things I have never done or almost never done.

This projet will contain a fully fonctionnal social network where :

 - users should be able to post texts and/or pictures
 - users should be able to follow each other
 - users should be able to comment a post
 - users should be able to like or dislike a post
 
 - users should be able to have some kind of SMS 2FA (if possible for free)
 - users should be able to have a google auth 2FA setup on their account
 - users should not be able to login if their email isn't verified                      ✔️

 - the login form should contain a remember me button
 - the login form should contain a way to reset your password if you lost it
 - the login and register form should contain a google reCaptcha
 - the app should able a usable public API
